# Excerpts from Miyamoto Musashi's work that is about sword-fighting. On the surface.
The Book of Five Rings=
    By knowing the large, you know the small; and from the shallow you reach the deep.
    You get used to any weapon; without imitating others, choose one appropriate, one that you can handle.
    If a man obtains the virtue of the sword, he can defeat ten men. Then one hundred can defeat one thousand. You should investigate this thoroughly.
    Everyone has preferences of their own heart, and each eye will have its own distortions. As a warrior, have no confusion in your mind; never be lazy at any moment of the day.
    Polish the two hearts (your mind and will) and sharpen the two eyes (broad observation and focused vision). Make a strong effort.
    Temper yourself with one thousand days of practice; refine yourself with ten thousand days of training. Surpass today what you were yesterday, go beyond those of poor skill tomorrow, exceed those who are skilled later.
    Think without rushing, one step at a time. The mind that defeats one man is the same for innumerable opponents.
    Be intent on winning no matter the situation by making use of your knowledge. Don't overthink it. The details are few.
    Don't wait for the perfect moment, it's no different from being constantly on the defensive.
    The way of emptiness: having attained the principles, you leave them.
    Think without dishonesty.
    Forge yourself in the way.
    Touch upon all the arts.
    Know the way of all occupations.
    Know advantages and disadvantages of everything.
    Develop a discerning eye in all matters.
    Understand what cannot be seen by the eye.
    Pay attention to even small things.
    Do not involve yourself with the impractical.
